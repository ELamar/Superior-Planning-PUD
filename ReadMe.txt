Collaborative PUD Notice and Comment.

This project seeks to implement a collaborative notice and comment process for Planned Unit Development Projects.  In addition to the ReadMe.txt, there is a text file containing the PUD District Standards Form Table outlined in the City of Tallahasseeâ€™s Application for PUD Review Packet. 

You may provide input by cloning the PUD text file, editing it and resubmitting it for consideration.  Suggestions may be incorporated by [me] and included as commits or changes to the main file.

You may also provide input through the issues tab.  Comments will be responded to promptly.
